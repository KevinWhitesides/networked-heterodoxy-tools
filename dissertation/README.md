# Dissertation Resources: Networked Heterodoxy Tools

This module contains scripts, workflows, and documentation used in the computational analysis for the dissertation:

*Networks of Heterodoxy: Shared Dissent and the Dynamics of Counter-Discourse.*

The tools support the analysis of **structured cultural datasets**, including binary incidence matrices and topic-model outputs, enabling the construction and analysis of co-occurrence networks, bipartite graphs, and related structures.

Scripts are organized **by methodological task rather than dataset**, allowing them to be reused across multiple case studies.

## Repository Structure

- `01_diagnostics/` — Threshold and structural diagnostics for calibrating network construction.
- `02_networks/` — Construction of one-mode and bipartite networks, similarity matrices, and networks derived from topic models.
- `03_metrics/` — Network metric analysis including brokerage, centrality, and structural measurements.
- `04_topic_modeling/` — MALLET pipelines, pyLDAvis visualizations, and topic dendrogram construction.
- `docs/` — Methodological notes, data format specifications, and supporting documentation.
- `workflows/` — Descriptions of how scripts were applied in specific case studies (e.g., the 2012 literature corpus and the Five Percenter Hip Hop corpus).

## Data Format Assumptions

Most network scripts assume input in the form of a **binary incidence matrix** — a spreadsheet representing relationships between cases and features.

Typical structure:

- Rows = cases (books, songs, etc.)
- Columns = tropes, topics, or features
- Presence indicated by `"X"`
- Absence left blank

From this matrix, the scripts construct:

- bipartite case × trope networks
- projected one-mode trope × trope networks
- co-occurrence matrices
- network metrics and structural diagnostics
